					{% blocktranslate %} My work stems from a deep fascination with the
					potter's wheel and the forms that emerge from circular movement.
					{%endblocktranslate %}
				</p>
				<p>
					{% blocktranslate %} I am interested in rotation: that primary,
					repetitive, and constant gesture that allows us to think about time,
					form, and memory. {% endblocktranslate %}
				</p>
				<p>
					{% blocktranslate %} In my practice, the circle and concentric forms
					are inevitable presences. I am drawn to their ability to reveal
					movement, their enveloping quality, and their insistence. They define
					not only the aesthetics of my pieces but embody a vision of time as
					something that repeats, accumulates, and intertwines.
					{%endblocktranslate %}
				</p>
				<p>
					{% blocktranslate %} I work with the circle as a structure open to
					constant transformation, that contains and, at the same time, is
					infinite. {% endblocktranslate %}
				</p>
				<p>
					{% blocktranslate %} In this process, color is a tool that intervenes
					directly in the construction of formal language. It allows me to
					highlight planes, outline volumes, and mark rhythms, tracing visual
					accents that guide the gaze and reveal internal tensions. Color does
					not decorate: it activates the surface, exposes its layers, and
					amplifies the form. {% endblocktranslate %}

					{% blocktranslate %} Trained as an Industrial Designer, she finds in
